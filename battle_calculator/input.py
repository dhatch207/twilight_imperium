### takes input from frontend, and converts them to fleet structs ###

# needs to account for faction abilities and unit upgrades 

# needs to account for cost of ships in ordering (highest cost ships have lower i.d.)
    # also capacity, maybe have ships include the cost of what they are carrying?

# fleet struct looks like 
# attacker = { id: {'type' = 'cruiser', 'attacks' = [7]} ] }
